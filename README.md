# coding-textbook
A service for providing assigned readings to students.

## Developing the application
This project has been configured with a docker-compose development environment.  You must have docker and docker-compose installed, and if working in a Windows environment we highly recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux with Docker Desktop and VS Code.

Currently, this repository is configured to run in a "development mode" where the code in each project is mounted as a volume in their respective Docker containers. More work must be done to update the `Dockerfile.dev` files to properly Dockerize this project for deployment.

Step 1: you must install NodeJS version 16 on your system (recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage NodeJS versions). Then, clone the repository and run `npm install` from both the client and server directories:

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ cd ../server
$ npm install
```

***IMPORTANT*** Make sure to complete the above step before continuing to the next steps, if you dont you will create errors that can only be fixed by deleting the clone and recreating it


Step 2: Once the required software has been installed, build using the terminal command:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

Step 3: And then launch the server and client with:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Step 4: You should then be able to access the service at http://localhost:3000. 

Both the client and server do hot code reloading, so you the server and/or client reboot and redeploy as you save changes in the code.  The only exception is changes to the dependencies and package file, which require a rebuild using `npm install` and through docker-compose.
